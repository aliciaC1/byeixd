          <p>What I like most about being a part of the PVD hub is the people. All of the co-workers I have been placed on teams with have been of a high caliber: smart, eager, professional, and pleasant to work with. I have also been impressed with the gender diversity, as there are many women in our studio, especially in positions of authority. Kudos to Scott and the Infosys leadership team for hiring such a great group of folks for the PVD office and for putting so many women in leadership positions.

          <p>Being part of the IXD family has helped me grow as a designer, leader and overall person. It’s given me opportunities where I get to learn from super knowledgeable folks and given me opportunities to lead/foster the younger design talent. My experience has taught me a lot of things about myself and forced me to evolve in areas where I was stagnant. For that, and so much more, I feel really thankful and lucky to be a part of this team that Scott has started.</p>

          <p>My favorite part about being a part of the PVD hub is the never ending evolution of our hub, our designers and our studio culture. It has been such an experience to see how the PVD hub has come to life over the past 2 years – the original group of us have seen so much growth! From participating in the first RISD strategic design training, to finding workspace in a ballroom of the Marriott hotel, to literally watching 75 Fountain be built from the ground up, it has been an unforgettable journey. And none of this could have been done without Scott’s vision + support - I still remember how exciting it was to watch Scott present on the very first day in Providence to a group of excited (and anxious) new designers. He has always been an inspiration filled with big dreams for what we would become and I wish him the very best for whatever he dreams up next.</p>

          <p>As one of the newest members joining Infosys, it was a pleasure meeting you and interacting with you a few times. In the few interactions we had, you have helped me felt welcome at this company. You also helped and made sure our trip to Dallas for Nile was all planned and finalized by calling your secretary on a holiday. That simple gesture and willingness to help is what will be dearly missed at this office. I am saddened to not be able to work with you directly on future projects. I wish you the best on your next venture!</p>
