Thank you for bringing together IXD and the PVD studio, as it has connected me to many great minds. All of the co-workers I have been placed on teams with have been of a high caliber: smart, eager, professional, and pleasant to work with. I have also been impressed with the gender diversity, as there are many women in our studio, especially in positions of authority. The hub has slowly turned into a second home where I feel comfortable to be myself and empowered enough to know my opinion along with other opinions matter greatly. I love coming to work every day surrounded by innovative, creative thinkers, out of the box, soul searchers.  Scott Sorokin is best in class when it comes to all of these – and why his brain child was the PVD studio. My favorite part about being a part of the PVD hub is the never ending evolution of our hub, our designers and our studio culture."
