        Scott, relocating to providence after graduating college was such an exciting but nerve racking experience. Meeting people with such diverse skills and backgrounds along with senior managers who were adept in so many things I was wondering how to be as involved in the building of this hub and bring my skills to the table. Days before the big inauguration of this office I would’ve never thought I’d meet such an approachable leader let alone a fellow Blue Hen AND VC Grad to put all my worries at ease! Thanks for the spark you brought to all of us and good luck wherever the future may take you next.

      Being a part of IXD has been a truly life changing experience. It has given me the chance to start my career with an amazing company, exposed me to new ways of thinking, and introduced me to the amazing group of people at the PVD Hub. None of this would have been possible without your leadership. So, thank you Scott and I wish you well in the future.

        IXD has empowered me to use my design skills in a very broad range of ways. It’s allowed me to put on multiple hats, and even step into the shoes of a strategist. This freedom to connect the two domains of design and strategy have been at the forefront of my experience here, and you made that possible. Learning that design can be a superpower within the world of strategy is something I will take with me throughout my career and beyond. <br>
        "Design is intelligence made visible." I’ll always remember that quote not only because it was on of your favorites, but also because it captures everything that I value about design and its potential to make sense of the complexity of the world around us. <br>
        You always mention superheros. If IXD were the Marvel Universe, you’d — without a doubt —  be Iron Man.

      You were my introduction to Infosys. From the first day on the job, you made my arrival at Infosys a remarkable and beautiful event amidst the complexity that accompanies any new venture into the workforce. As a member of the first cohort team, you provided well needed inspiration and guidance for us, especially during the times of struggle and doubt, as we ventured through various temporary workspaces, eventually settling into our permanent home at the Providence hub today.
  <br>Thank you, the design studio today contains a beautiful assortment of individuals from a variety of backgrounds and experience, which complement our unique assets and talents. It was a great pleasure and honor to get to know you and work within your vision. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

      My favorite part about being a part of the PVD hub is the never ending evolution of our hub, our designers and our studio culture. It has been such an experience to see how the PVD hub has come to life over the past 2 years – the original group of us have seen so much growth! From participating in the first RISD strategic design training, to finding workspace in a ballroom of the Marriott hotel, to literally watching 75 Fountain be built from the ground up, it has been an unforgettable journey. And none of this could have been done without Scott’s vision + support - I still remember how exciting it was to watch Scott present on the very first day in Providence to a group of excited (and anxious) new designers. He has always been an inspiration filled with big dreams for what we would become and I wish him the very best for whatever he dreams up next. <br>
           Being part of the IXD family has helped me grow as a designer, leader and overall person. It’s given me opportunities where I get to learn from super knowledgeable folks and given me opportunities to lead/foster the younger design talent. My experience has taught me a lot of things about myself and forced me to evolve in areas where I was stagnant. For that, and so much more, I feel really thankful and lucky to be a part of this team that Scott has started. <br>

      What I like most about being a part of the PVD hub is the people. All of the co-workers I have been placed on teams with have been of a high caliber: smart, eager, professional, and pleasant to work with. I have also been impressed with the gender diversity, as there are many women in our studio, especially in positions of authority. Kudos to Scott and the Infosys leadership team for hiring such a great group of folks for the PVD office and for putting so many women in leadership positions.

      As one of the newest members joining Infosys, it was a pleasure meeting you and interacting with you a few times. In the few interactions we had, you have helped me felt welcome at this company. You also helped and made sure our trip to Dallas for Nile was all planned and finalized by calling your secretary on a holiday. That simple gesture and willingness to help is what will be dearly missed at this office. I am saddened to not be able to work with you directly on future projects. I wish you the best on your next venture!

      Being a part of IXD has expanded the way I see the world. Instead of merely seeing a problem and its immediate context, I now see the problem and its system­; everything is interconnected in a holistic manner. A simple object can be expanded or contracted – the scope changing. Do I look at the parts, the shape, the color...? Or do I look at the history and the context?
 
     <br> Analysis is only half of it. What one does with information is just as important as the steps preceding it. The other half – of collaboration – is where magic happens. What I’ve learned is that good design does not come without some tension. If there aren’t sparks flying in the room, then go back to the drawing board.
       
     <br> The diversity of IXD is conducive to innovation and has such great potential. It’s amazing to have people from different backgrounds come together to collaborate, offering unique perspectives and challenging each other’s way of thinking. Thank you Scott for fostering diversity at IXD.    </p>

      Thank you so much for an incredible opportunity to be a part of the Providence Hub. I truly believe there is something extra special here. I have been here for about 10 months, and I have already learned so much through my projects and from my fellow PVD “hub-sters.” I can also honestly say that my experience in the RISD training was far beyond what I expected. It pushed me and expanded my ability to conceptualize ideas beyond what they were. I find myself bringing this valuable skill into my projects till this day.

I'm super lucky to work with a group of badass women and I've already had the opportunity to work on two incredible projects--much of which I owe to you. Thank you for believing in my portfolio and my design potential. I'm grateful for the difference you've made in my life, and in the lives of those in the Providence office. <br>

I am always excited to think of new ideas and to contribute to innovation. Being a designer at Infosys has allowed me to build upon my knowledge of technology and design. I have been able to learn from some of the best people through design collaboration. IXD has encouraged me to challenge the status quo and to evaluate the possibilities of design. My career has been a blast so far, and Infosys XD played a huge role in it.    </p>

      At PVD, It creates better visibility on what the UX team does. It’s much easier to implement a change when other professionals are under one roof and understand what you do. Collaboration and communication is super easy on tackling the some of the complex projects at PVD.  I’m a firm believer in “design influencing product strategy” early on and not just meant to be considered at the end of the execution process. With a strong investment in coaching and mentoring which starts with our open communication — the team at PVD will perform to the highest expectations.

      My favorite thing I’ve learned about in my time at the PVD hub is about design systems and connecting that with the learnings from RISD training. Each atom of the system must be considered in it’s next greater context, just like a piece of furniture or architecture. An icon lives in a button, which lives within a module, which lives in a screen, which lives in a flow, which lives in a platform. The gestalt of a platform depends on the relationship between each individual atom of the system. The process of learning this has been a delight at IXD. Thanks, Scott, for the opportunity.     </p>

      PVD Studio and the platform that Scott built for us was and is still a crazy ride that I'm really happy be a part of. It was a ride that was full of both challenges and accomplishments. From the first RISD training, to coming into an enormous office with 10 people, to the juggernaut design team we have now, it has truly been a rollercoaster haha. It's amazing though. I've learned so much from each project and have made strong friendships. The hub has slowly turned into a second home where I feel comfortable to be myself and empowered enough to know my opinion along with other opinions matter greatly. Thank you for building this and trusting us to continue forward. You’ll be missed, hopefully you’ll pop in every now and then! 🏴‍☠️    </p>

It really pushed my ability to think outside of the box, dig deeper in my mind, and all while having fun at the same time. The curriculum and the instructors were well selected and we all learned so much over the 4 weeks. I was sad to watch it end. Anyone who gets to be a part of that experience is very lucky! Providence/HUB is a very special place! We have so many people from all different walks of life and each person brings something special to the office. I am grateful to  be working with such smart, talented, technology/innovation driven people in such a beautiful space. Thank you for doing all of that for us Scott! We will miss you dearly. I hope the next chapter of your life is filled with happiness and excitement.

      My favorite aspect of being a part of the PVD Hub is the people. As it is my first full-time design position, I am so glad and so grateful that everyone in the hub is kind and talented. A lot of what makes the PVD Hub the way it is is thanks to you, so thank you so much for what you have done for XD. Best wishes on all your future endeavors!
