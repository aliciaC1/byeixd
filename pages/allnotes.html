              <q>You were my introduction to Infosys. From the first day on the job, you made my arrival at Infosys a remarkable and beautiful event amidst the complexity that accompanies any new venture into the workforce. As a member of the first cohort team, you provided well needed inspiration and guidance for us, especially during the times of struggle and doubt, as we ventured through various temporary workspaces, eventually settling into our permanent home at the Providence hub today. <br> <Br>

                Thank you, the design studio today contains a beautiful assortment of individuals from a variety of backgrounds and experience, which complement our unique assets and talents. It was a great pleasure and honor to get to know you and work within your vision. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.</q>

              <span class="actor">Dominic Rapp</span>
              <q>You know what a squab is. It's like a
                pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of
                bird we can eat.</q>

              <q>Should we go through the hole under the
                horse fence or climb the rail over the
                bridle path?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="actor">Gabriela Santiago</span>
              <q>Well, I guess the horse fence would be a little safer.</q>

            <p>
              <span class="actor">Grace Kim</span>

              <q>What's wrong? I've never seen you like
                this. You're acting all skittish. Don't
                worry. I've been stealing birds for a
